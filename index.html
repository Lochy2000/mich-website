          <h3>Creativity</h3>
          <p>
            In our time together, I offer prompts and ideas, but ultimately I let the child lead. I act as a creative companion to facilitate open-ended exploration - someone to take even the silliest ideas seriously. Together we do anything from make a movie to writing a song, do crafts or baking, go bug hunting in the forest or make sandcastles at the beach. We might work on a project for several weeks or just explore something for an hour.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a child already has a specific artistic interest, I am someone who bring ideas and structure to that. Or perhaps a child is not the 'artistic type' (although I don't believe that), then our time together is about play and exploration, spending time in their world and letting their imagination lead.
          </p>

          <h3>Confidence</h3>
          <p>
            I believe that the act of creating something/anything in the world can be extremely empowering. It gives a sense of agency and independence. The process of creation requires skills of imagination, problem-solving, commitment to follow through an idea and reflection - all the necessary components of becoming a creative and independent thinker. The act of creating something can build a greater sense of identity and self, which can hugely boost a child's self-esteem. These are all things I am deeply motivated to bring through creative nannying.
          </p>

          <h3>Curiosity</h3>
          <p>
            In our time together, curiosity might look like slowing down, noticing small details, following a hunch, or wondering why something is the way it is. It can emerge through walking, observing, collecting, listening, talking, storytelling or spending time with an idea. I try to create a space where children feel free to follow their interests without the pressure to perform or produce something 'useful'. Curiosity becomes a way of engaging with the world with openness and care, a skill that often gets lost in busy, outcome-driven environments.

          <h3>Where?</h3>
          <p>
            Creative nannying can take place in your home, outdoors in nature or through visits to museums and cultural spaces: always guided by what feels right for the parents and the child.
          </p>

          <h3>How?</h3>
          <p>
            Each session looks different. I might bring some fun materials to get us started or we find inspiration at home or outside. Some days might need more prompting or structure, while others are about exploration and getting lost together. The first few sessions are spent getting to know each other and finding the best way to create together. But throughout, the focus is on the process, not perfection.
          </p>

          <h3>Who?</h3>
          <p>
            I primarily work with kids between the ages of 6-12. That said, I'm always happy to have a conversation to see if we're a good fit, as each child and family is different. I think the space to explore creativity and curiosity is beneficial to every child, yet it could be especially transformative for a child with low self esteem or social difficulties. In these cases, I am not an art therapist in any sense, but someone who is present and attentive in order to deepen their interests and sense of expression. I have some experience working with kids with ADD, ADHD and mild autism. My main working language is English, so I am best suited to international or expat families in The Netherlands.
          </p>

          <h3>When?</h3>
          <p>
            Creative nannying overlaps with childcare, so we might schedule a session when parents are out for the evening or afternoon. I'm comfortable working independently with children, and I also understand that families may be present, especially at the beginning.

              My name is Miche. I am 28 years old, half Danish, half Irish. I am an artist and musician, with a lifelong interest in education and community building.
            </p>

            <h3 class="about-me-subheading">Why I do what I do</h3>

            <p>My childhood was spent moving countries a lot - from Brussels to China to England. Art and creativity emerged early on as ways to feel connected to these new places and to myself amidst frequent transition.</p>

            <p>In England I found myself in a highly competitive schooling environment, constantly chasing the highest grades and accolades, yet in hindsight missing out on a lot of silliness and play. Through my teens I also began working as a tutor at a weekend school, but more than anything, this made me question an educational system that valued conformity over experimentation.</p>

            <p>After school, I did an art foundation at Central Saint Martins in London and then onto a bachelors in Design at Goldsmiths University. This course wasn't about designing chairs or clothes, but rather about how to create the environments and structures that encourage novel thinking and imagination. I became very interested in how we best create the conditions for creation itself.</p>

            <p>After completing my bachelors I moved to Berlin where I worked as an assistant in a creative technology school - School of Machines, Making and Make Believe. This school was just as much about learning creative coding as it was about daring students of all ages to not only imagine alternatives for the world, but to actively build them. In Berlin I found my way to performance art, music making, a more free sense of expression and community. I was living in a collective housing project with 30 other people and this is also where I discovered the joy of sharing a home and artmaking with kids.</p>

            <p>Three years later, when I moved to the Hague to study my masters at KABK, I was intent on keeping up this connection to children. I started volunteering with Vitalis, an organisation that buddies kids and adults in the Hague and here I became a buddy to an 8 year old. We spent many playdates on the beach, playing football, rollerskating and on discovering his love for youtube, we started shooting and editing videos together. Up until this moment he hadn't considered himself the 'artsy type' and this is when I realised how much creation could empower and embolden kids today.</p>

            <p>I started teaching swimming to kids and quickly realised my priority was not to teach impeccable technique, but to inspire a confident and joyful relationship to water, like the one I have always had I always try to bring a sense of agency and autonomy to my classes by asking the kids to explain the exercises to each other and following the suggestions they make for our classes.</p>

            <p>I finished my masters recently in the summer of 2025. Rather than make the art I had intended, I couldn't ignore the failing system behind the art education I was receiving. The educational institution itself became the subject of my research, and I spent a lot of my time organising alternate education spaces with the student union.</p>

            <p>This now remains my interest - to explore what kind of art pedagogy can exist outside of institutions and formal schooling. Whether it's at university level or primary school, the question guiding everything I do is - how do we create the independent and critical thinkers that the world so desperately needs today? I believe very much in the power of creativity in this pursuit. Creativity is something that exists inherently in us all, in so many different forms that school doesn't tell us about. The institution of art and professionalisation of the 'artist' made us all believe only The Artists can make art, and this is a myth I want to dispel.</p>
