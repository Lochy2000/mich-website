        <div class="services-content" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
          <p>Kids have an inherent curiosity for the world, brimming with imagination. As a creative nanny, I facilitate this exploration, accompany open-ended creative play to cultivate greater confidence, self-knowledge and independence in a child. I am a supportive presence to listen, encourage and deepen a child's imagination.</p>

          <h3>How does it work?</h3>
          <p>I spend some time getting to know the unique interests of a child and then offer some structures or ideas to kickstart a creative process. I bring materials, make suggestions or simply pay attention and go along with a child's imagination. Each child is different, so the time is always tailored to them and their needs. The emphasis is always on experimentation and exploration without judgement or correction.</p>

          <p>We might explore something for just an hour or start a longer project together. We might:</p>
          <p>
            - organise a party<br>
            - write a song<br>
            - start a band<br>
            - design a video game<br>
            - make clay figures<br>
            - go to the forest<br>
            - invent a new recipe<br>
            - write silly poems
          </p>

          <p>We might decide to take small outings, for example to the forest or the zoo or the garden centre to see what inspiration we find there! </p>

          <h3>My approach</h3>
          <p>For me, creativity is more than giving kids paints and paper. It's a way of seeing the world and staying open to curiosity and possibilities. Spending time, talking, observing, asking questions, going for a walk, playing, making up stories are all valued parts of a creative process. I don't force a 'project' into the sessions if it doesn't emerge naturally.</p>

          <p>As much as possible, I let the child decide and lead because I want this agency to choose to be an empowering experience. Leaving time for emptiness, boredom, uncertainty or frustration are equally vital parts of a creative process that accompany children through.</p>

          <p>Our sessions are always screen-free, unless we are intentionally creating something digitally.</p>

          <h3>Why creative nannying?</h3>
          <p>In creating, we exercise the part of ourselves that is most original and individual and come away feeling empowered, proud and with a stronger sense of self-knowing!</p>

          <p>In a time of over abundant stimulation and distraction available at every moment, it is all the more important that there are spaces for children to come to their own conclusions and new ideas. With a high pressure to perform in school and get the 'right' answers, we are not always taught to become independent thinkers. That's why creative nannying is a place without wrong or right, without grades or expectations, only an encouraging presence to express and be yourself.</p>

          <h3>When does a session take place?</h3>
          <p>We might schedule a session when parents are out for the evening or afternoon. I'm comfortable working independently with children, and I also understand that families may be present, especially at the beginning.</p>

          <h3>Who is it for?</h3>
          <p>I primarily nanny kids between the ages of 6-12 but I'm always happy to have a conversation to see if we're a good fit, as each child and family is different.</p>

          <p>The sessions are ideally one-on-one, but I am also happy nannying multiple kids.</p>

          <p>My working language is English, so I am best suited to international or expat families.</p>

          <h3>Pricing</h3>
          <p>I charge 40/hour, or 350€ for a prepaid block of 10 hours, but this may vary depending on how many kids there are.</p>

          <p>Included in this price are any basic materials I use in our sessions and the first get-to-know-eachother visit.</p>

          <h3>Security and liability</h3>
          <p>I hold a VOG certification (criminal record check) that legally permits me to work with kids in The Netherlands, which can be shared upon request. What your child shares during our time together is treated with care and confidentiality, however, if I hear, sense, or observe anything that suggests your child may be in danger, I am ethically and legally required to act.</p>

          <p>I am insured for personal and professional liability during our time together.</p>

              My name is Miche, I am a 28 years old artist and musician. I am half Danish, half Irish and I grew up as an expat kid living in many different countries. I moved to The Hague two years ago to study my masters at the KABK.
            </p>

            <p>Education has always been something I've been very passionate about. I went through a very competitive schooling system in the UK as a teenager and longer for more spaces for creativity outside of this very formal education. I went to art school at Central Saint Martins and Goldsmiths University in London, before moving to Berlin. Here I worked in a creative technology school, <a href="https://www.schoolofma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Machines, Make and Making-believe</a>, where I was being exposed to many different pedagogical approaches to art education. I was living communally and with children, making art together after school and on the weekends. So when I moved to The Hague, this was something I wanted to keep up. I started volunteering with <a href="https://vitalismaatjes.nl/?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=18960591810&gbraid=0AAAAADLpfhKd6oaRtDBZsmr-KyBPz8acg&gclid=CjwKCAiA7LzLBhAgEiwAjMWzCEFa0DAEanqXB1vZAaG1ffY16-QzkyLfpxntrQy4RPTfsv3b3prxWxoCftIQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vitalis</a> as a buddy to children around The Hague. As kindred creatives, we naturally pursued artistic projects together and this is also when I realised how empowering it was to encourage kids in their creative pursuits this way.</p>

            <p>My approach to art has always been a very social and collaborative one, rather than a strictly professional ambition. I believe that creativity serves a greater and higher role in society than being locked into galleries - this is why I choose to spend my energy on creative nannying, because I sincerely wish for the world to be a more creative and imaginative place, and that it is not only artists who hold this capacity.</p>
